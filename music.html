             <p>There's a girl, I think I know 
<br>Better than anyone you know.. oh-oh
<br>When she cries, she tries to hide it
<br>When she's weak, she acts like she's strong enough
<br>And break the walls inside her heart</p>


<p>That girl is missing you
<br>But she can't say it straight
<br>She couldn't eat her words
<br>That she is not gonna say...</p>

<p>Not gonna say, "I love you"
<br>Not gonna say, "I miss you"
<br>Not gonna say, "I care for you"
<br>Even though she didn't mean to</p>

<p>She wants you to say you love her
<br>She wants you to say you think of her
<br>She wants to hear the words you used to say
<br>And hear your voice each hour everyday
<br>Mmm.. Mmm...</p>


<p>I talked to her and tried to tell her
<br>It's not right to feel what she feels inside
   <br> Just try to burn them down the fire</p>

<p>She was quiet for a while
<br>Kept her thoughts deeply in the night
<br>Told her to make up her mind</p>

<p>She simply walked away 
<br>Though I know she's okay
<br>Next thing I knew was that
    <br>She told you not to say...</p>

<p>Not to say, "I love you"
<br>Not to say, "I miss you"
<br>Not to say, "I care for you"
<br>Even though she didn't mean to</p>

<p>She wants you to say you love her
<br>She wants you to say you think of her
<br>She wants to hear the words you used to say
<br>And hear your voice each hour everyday
<br>Mmm.. Mmm...</p>

             <p>I still believe in fairy tales 
<br>Snow white and my Teddy Bears
<br>They are still part of me
<br>The child that I once used to be



<p>I used to say, "When I grow old"
<br>"I'd surely make a better world"
<br>But now that I'm old enough
<br>I don't think I've ever done my part</p>

<p>Who would make this world a better place to live
<br>When no one will care; no one will share
<br>Who would make this world a better place for kids
<br>With parents who love, 'cause love is what they need</p>

<p>Why do we always love ourselves
<br>And never care for others' sake
<br>What if we were the ones
    <br>Who need love but no one's around</p>



<p>Some people say that love is blind
<br>Some say it sees but doesn't mind
   <br> But then I'd say it's from the heart
                 <br>Not from the eyes that just criticize</p>

<p>Who would make this world a better place to live
<br>When no one will care; no one will share
<br>Who would make this world a better place for kids
<br>With parents who love, 'cause love is what they need</p>

<p>Why do you live, why do we live
<br>In this world right now
<br>What is the plan from heaven that we can't understand
    <br>We always seek for happiness through things that we got
    <br>But never knew that it should come from people who love</p>

<p>Who would make this world a better place to live
<br>When no one will care; no one will share
<br>Who would make this world a better place for kids
<br>With parents who love, 'cause love is what they need</p>

                 <p>With parents who love, 'cause love is what... love is what they need</p>

             <p>I don't know why, but each time I fall
<br>No one is catching me
<br>Some peopel tried to give me their love
                 <br>And tried to believe in me </p>



<p>But I just couldn't love them the way
<br>Like the way that they care for me
    <br>And it feels like I haven't found you 'til now</p>


<p>Hey, Mr. Right, won't you come here tonight and save me from this woe
<br>I don't know how but maybe you'll arrive, just please knock on my door
<br>I've been waiting for you all my life
<br>Don't wannt waste each day passing by
                 <br>If you hear me, I'm calling you now.. Oh..</p>

<p>I try to be strong, yet feel so alone living in my own way
<br>I'm happy, I know, here with my friends
    <br>Living our lives today </p>
 



<p>But I just couldn't feel I belong
<br>In their world where the wind is so strong
   <br> I feel cold yet I have to go on
                 <br>To say...</p>

<p>Hey, Mr. Right, won't you come here tonight and save me from this woe
<br>I don't know how but maybe you'll arrive, just please knock on my door
<br>I've been waiting for you all my life
<br>Don't wannt waste each day passing by
                 <br>If you hear me, I'm calling you now.. Oh..</p>
                 
<p>Yes I know I will find you somehow.. Oh...
